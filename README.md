# Vehicle-Network-Resourc-Visualization

## Introduction

To study the current sales and geographical distribution of automotive resources in China, analyze and forecast the current situation and future development of electric vehicles, this design focuses on the implementation of a vehicle network resource management system and the use of relevant data to predict the sales of various car brands and electric vehicles. In the research process, the data obtained from the crawler was firstly analyzed by using Spark for data analysis. Next, the results of the data analysis were visualized using the pyecharts framework. Meanwhile, the vehicle resource management system was accomplished. Finally, the vehicle prices were categorized using clustering. And, using multiple linear regression and polynomial regression, I finished the prediction of the sales of each brand and the electric vehicle. 

## Usage

### Web Crawler

The data I used was referenced from “auto.16888.com”. This is a brilliant website which shows all the detail information about chinese car market. I slightly changed some code to suit for my needs. Details are in "webCrawler/".

### Visualization Websites

I use [pyecharts](https://pyecharts.org/#/en-us/) to visualize the data. Download the website page located in "visualizationWebsite/". You could double click the file if you download successfully.
